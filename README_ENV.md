# Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The `.env.example` file is provided as a template.

## Note
- Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix for environment variables to be exposed to the client
- Restart the dev server after changing environment variables
